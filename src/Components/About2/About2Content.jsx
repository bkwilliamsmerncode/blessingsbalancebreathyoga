                Blessings Balance Breath Yoga welcomes Alicia Lammie, serving on the Board of Directors.
                Donna was very fortunate to meet Alicia in 2022 while working at Perryville. Donna was serving as the Principal/Education Programs Supervisor for the Arizona Department of Corrections, while Alicia was teaching the business and personal development courses through Rio Salado College. Learning they both share a love for yoga, the connection was immediate. 

Alicia Lammie leverages her MA degree in Business and BA degree in Human
Services Management, along with 20 years of intentionally profound personal and spiritual growth, to inspire and guide others.

For the past seven years, she has taught business and personal development courses at the Maricopa Community College District, dedicating five of those years to the incarcerated students at Perryville, the Women’s Correctional Rehabilitation and Reentry Facility in Arizona.

Alicia’s passion extends beyond business education to include teaching meditation and
coaching individuals to biohack limiting beliefs and using the principles of The Law of
Attraction to manifest their fullest potential. She also facilitates workshops on sacred geometry and abstract painting, guiding participants to tap into the frequencies of joy, creativity, and a heart-centered connection to unlock future success.

Her students often praise her inclusive and compassionate approach, sharing that “Mrs.
Lammie teaches to the whole person with love and without judgment.”

We look forward to you sharing all your incredible talents, skills, education, and experiences with the people we serve. Thank you so much, Alicia, for serving as Director on the Board of Blessings Balance Breath Yoga. We appreciate you!
